# WebPlatformDevCW1
This repo is for my work on Web Platform Development Coursework 1 and will be used to demonstrate my understanding and use of proper version control.
# Steps to getting started
~ Run these commands ~
#1 npm install express
#2 npm install nodemon
#3 npm install nedb
#4 npm install mustache-express
#5 npm install path
~ To execute code ~
#1 Run the code using nodemon index
#2 With nodemon running any changes made will be noticed as it's always listening and therefore just needs the page to be refreshed.
